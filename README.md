# FriendFinder

## About FriendFinder
FriendFinder is a compatability calculator that compares a user's answers to a quiestionnaire to find 'friends' with similar responses.

## Installation

## Usage

## Tecnhical Notes
* The application checks the name provided by the user to the users in the 'database' (json object) and excludes results from a 'friend' in the 'database' with the same name.  This is a clunky way to avoid potential duplicates and doesn't result in any new survey answers from being 'saved' for the user.  This check for duplicates was not part of the project requirements.
